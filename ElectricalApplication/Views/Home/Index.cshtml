            <!------- Explaining Ohms Law ---------->
            <h2>Ohms Law</h2>
            <p>Ohms Law describes the relationship between voltage, current and resistance. </p>
            <p>Voltage is often know as the electromotive force. Voltage can be reprecented as V or also as E. </p>
            <p>Current is the intensity of the electricity passing through a condutor. Current is often described as I. </p>
            <p>
                Resistance is the ability of a material to oppose the flow of current. In other words how much a material "resists"
                the flow of electricity. Resistance is often described as R.
            </p>

            <p>Voltage = (Current) X (Resistance)</p>

            <p>Current = (Voltage) / (Resistance)</p>

            <p>Resistance = (Voltage) / (Current)</p>
